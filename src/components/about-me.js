        <h2>A Brief Summary of Myself</h2>
        <p> In term of personality, I am an incredibly optimistic and layed back person.
          From work experience, I have a strong communication skills, I enjoy and thrived on working with others. I am currently
          a student in University of Liverpool studying Computer Science (2017 to 2021). I will be taking a year in industry to developed experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>My experiences in the fast paced technological driven world!</h2>
        <p>I have dabbled with technologies for years. I have never gotten serious. Until this year.</p>
        <p>I have worked with various technologies from developing Windows application, Games and Android development. I have
        used various programming languages from C++, Visual Basic, Haskell, Java to Pascal</p>
        <p>Today, I am mainly focusing on web applications. Playing around with endless APIs available out there</p>
        I like simple design. A good design should be invisible.

        Why do I write blog. To record the journeys of my life.
        To dumb down concepts I find difficult. Force myself to teach it to other (best way to learn)
